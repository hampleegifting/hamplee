FACTS ABOUT YOUR PRODUCT

Masala Bhatti is a method of blending the finest quality aromatic botanicals into a 'masala' and hand-rolling them onto a bamboo stick. This prominent part of incense therapy of ayurveda creates a purified and protected environment and dynamizes the balance of emotional and mental distress.
In addition to being delicate and sweet, frankincense has an earthy, woody, piney, or balsamic fragrance. Overall, the fragrance is calming to the mind and soul. The relaxing aroma is nuanced and beautifully balanced.
The Amogha Masala Incense sticks with their Frankincense fragrance are an absolute must-have for anyone looking to bring a sense of calm and serenity into their home. They are also great for use in bedrooms, living rooms, bathrooms, and even for aromatherapy. Each stick burns slowly and evenly, releasing the perfect amount of fragrance to create a truly immersive and indulgent experience.
The Amogha Masala Incense sticks with Frankincense fragrance are a beautiful and luxurious addition to any home that will give a divine lift to your spaces that relieves stress and promote relaxation. They are true treasures, a piece of art that will bring beauty and tranquility to your life.
